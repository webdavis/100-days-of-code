# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: October 24, 2024

#### Today's Progress

1. Created my GitHub Profile page
2. Revisited building prototypes using Xcode's Interface Builder and faking implementation
   details using animations.

#### Thoughts on GitHub Profile pages

I enjoyed creating my GitHub Profile page. Writing copy takes way more brain power than I
expected it would—just thinking about word choice and the different tones they evoke.

#### Thoughts on Prototyping

I’m currently implementing a vertically sliced spike of my weather app, Maeve, in order to get
a minimum viable product (MVP) up and running as quickly as possible. My focus is on designing
the user interface and simulating expected features so that I can dedicate the bulk of my time
implementing niche features that will attract users. For instance, I can use animations and
static data to mimic loading weather data from a remote API, but then actually implement
whatever needs to be implemented to have it tell the user what to wear that day.
